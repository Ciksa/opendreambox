  1 Introduction

   This document briefly describes the OpenDreambox distribution, an embedded
   Linux distribution for Set-Top-Boxes manufactured by Dream Property GmbH.

   OpenDreambox is based on the OpenEmbedded build framework, which uses BitBake
   to transform build instructions into distributable firmare images and software
   packages.

   The current version, OpenDreambox 2.5, is based on the Yocto Project, release
   2.1 ”Krogoth”, an umbrella project for OpenEmbedded and related tools.

    1.1 Target audience

   Developers familiar with previous versions of OpenDreambox or OpenEmbedded in
   general.

    1.2 Supported products

   The current version includes support for the following products:

    1.4 Obtaining the source code

   OpenDreambox uses the Git version control system. To obtain the source code, it
   is required to install Git. See http://git-_scm.com/.

   To initially download the source into the current directory, issue the
   following command:

   git clone -b krogoth git://git.opendreambox.org/git/opendreambox.git

   The Git repository can be viewed online at:

   http://git.opendreambox.org/?p=opendreambox.git

    1.5 Quick start

   For the impatient:

   make -C opendreambox image

   If this command fails, prerequisites may be missing. See section 3.

    1.6 Directory structure

   OpenDreambox consists of a set of layers containing build instructions. This
   meta data is used by BitBake to download and compile source code and to
   assemble installable software packages and firmware images.

   Currently, these layers are used:
     * meta-dreambox
     * meta-opendreambox
     * meta-openembedded/meta-filesystems
     * meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia
     * meta-openembedded/meta-networking
     * meta-openembedded/meta-oe
     * meta-openembedded/meta-python
     * meta-openembedded/meta-ruby
     * meta-openembedded/meta-webserver
     * meta-qt5
     * openembedded-core/meta

   If a recipe for the same package exists in multiple layers, then the higher
   priority layer takes precedence over the lower priority layer.

   For example, if libmad_0.15.1b.bb existed in both meta-openembedded and
   openembedded-core, the recipe in meta-openembedded would be used, because
   openembedded-core has lower priority. Priority values are determined by the
   variable BBFILE_PRIORITY in conf/layer.conf of each layer.

   NOTE: This would still be true even if the version of libmad in
   openembeded-core was higher than the version in meta-openembedded, unless
   PREFERRED_VERSION_libmad was set to the version in openembedded-core. There is
   currently no way to prefer a version of a lower priority layer, if the same
   version is present in a higher priority layer.

      1.6.1 openembedded-core and meta-openembedded

   These directories contain copies of Git repositories from git.openembedded.org,
   including the OpenEmbedded-Core layer and the (Meta-)OpenEmbedded layers. They
   get created automatically when building the distribution for the first time.

   Throughout this document, the combination of these directories will be referred
   to as OpenEmbedded.

   The latest changes to these Git repositories can be seen at:

   http://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-_core-_contrib/log/?h=obi/krogoth

   http://git.openembedded.org/meta-_openembedded-_contrib/log/?h=obi/krogoth

      1.6.2 meta-opendreambox

   This directory contains:
     * Recipes for packages written specifically for the OpenDreambox distribution
     * Modifications to recipes from OpenEmbedded
     * Recipes for software versions older than those available from OpenEmbedded
     * Recipes for software versions newer than those available from OpenEmbedded

      1.6.3 meta-dreambox

   The directory meta-dreambox contains Board Support Packages (BSP) for the
   supported Dreambox models. This includes:
     * Hardware drivers
     * Machine specific overrides
     * The Linux kernel
     * The boot loader
     * Splash images

  3 Prerequisites

    3.1 Required software

   The OpenEmbedded project provides a general list of prerequisites for many
   Linux distributions and also for some other operating systems.
     * http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Getting\_started#Required\_software

   It is highly recommended to use Linux to build OpenDreambox. In theory, any
   recent distribution will do, but not many distributions have been verified to
   build OpenDreambox without errors. Tested distributions include:
     * Debian 8.6 ”Jessie” [amd64]
     * Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS ”Xenial Xerus” [amd64]

  4 Major changes since previous public releases

    4.1 Changes since release 1.6

     * Recipes were split across multiple layers and categorized.
     * env.source has been replaced by two files, bitbake.env and
       cross-compile.env. The former sets a minimal environment that is needed to
       execute bitbake. The latter creates machine-specific command aliases, in
       order to compile external software.
     * All machines share a common tmp directory.
     * ${MACHINE}/build directories were renamed to build/${MACHINE}.
     * Kernel packages were renamed from linux-${MACHINE} to linux-dreambox.
     * Support for machines based on ATI Xilleon or IBM STB was dropped.

    4.2 Changes since release 2.0

     * Added support for DM520, DM525, DM820 and DM7080.
     * If a recipe changes, the corresponding packages will be rebuilt
       automatically, in contrast to required manual PR bumps in the past.
     * Each machine uses its own tmp directory again, like before 2.0. However,
       there is a shared sstate-cache, which allows to share already compiled data
       between compatible machines. This impacts performance and size of the build
       system, but improves reliability and consistency across builds.
     * Support for machines without FPU and kernel versions below 3.x was dropped
       (DM800).
     * Layers under meta-bsp were combined into meta-dreambox.
     * Default package format switched from ipk (opkg) to deb (dpkg + apt).
     * dreambox-image was renamed to include the package format
       (dreambox-image-deb).

    4.3 Changes since release 2.2

     * Added support for DM900.
     * Machines with low memory were dropped (DM500HD, DM800SE).
     * Switched from Qt4 to Qt5.

  5 Known Issues

     * Unsupported machines present in meta-dreambox (DM500HDv2, DM800SEv2,
       DM7020HD, DM7020HDv2, DM8000) are known not to work unless booted with a
       kernel of release 1.6, which however shows incompatibilities with systemd.
       Additionally, there appear to be problems rendering the user interface.

  6 Building OpenDreambox

   In the top level directory, there is a Makefile, which is used to set up build
   directories and to fetch or update all used repositories. The Makefile can be
   influenced by environment variables, either by specifing them on the
   command-line or by storing them in a file called conf/make.conf. It is not
   recommended to edit the Makefile directly in order to avoid conflicts with
   future updates.

   When the Makefile is run for the first time, the following steps will be
   executed:
     * Creation of configuration files
          * bitbake.env
          * conf/opendreambox.conf
          * build/${MACHINE}/conf/bblayers.conf
          * build/${MACHINE}/conf/local.conf
     * Update or checkout of Git repositories
          * OpenDreambox
          * BitBake
          * OpenEmbedded

    6.1 Makefile targets

   Run make help to get a list of targets of the top level Makefile, together with
   a brief description.

    6.2 Configuration variables

      6.2.1 BB_NUMBER_THREADS

   Controls how many BitBake tasks may run at a time. Defaults to the number of
   cores available on the build system.

      6.2.2 MACHINE

   Controls the target machine to build packages for. See section 1.2 for a list
   of supported products.

      6.2.3 PARALLEL_MAKE

   Controls how many processes per recipe make may use. Defaults to the number of
   cores available on the build system.

    6.3 Adding custom layers

   It is possible to add custom layers to the build system. This can be done
   globally and per machine. To add a layer globally, edit conf/bblayers-ext.conf.
   To add a machine-specific layer, edit conf/bblayers-${MACHINE}-ext.conf.
   Assuming that an additional layer is available at ${HOME}/custom-layer, the
   entry to add to the file will look like this:

   BBLAYERS =+ "${HOME}/custom-layer"

    6.4 Adding custom options

   It is possible to tweak a lot more options than those used by the Makefile by
   editing conf/local-ext.conf or conf/local-${MACHINE}-ext.conf.

   For example, if the firmware shall use the package feed built on the develoment
   machine, which happens to be 192.168.1.1 and has a webserver configured to
   point to tmp/deploy/ipk, a line like the following may be added:

   DISTRO_FEED_URI = "http://192.168.1.1/${DISTRO}/${DISTRO_VERSION}"

   In general, any variable in OpenEmbedded that uses weak assignment (?=) may be
   overridden from these files.

   The following sections list some commonly used options.

      6.4.1 DISTRO_FEED_PREFIX

   DISTRO_FEED_PREFIX specifies the name of the package update feed. This name may
   be chosen arbitarily.

   Default: DISTRO_FEED_PREFIX = "remote"

      6.4.2 DISTRO_FEED_URI

   DISTRO_FEED_URI specifies the URI of the package update feed.

   Default: DISTRO_FEED_URI = "http://my-distribution.example/remote-feed/"

      6.4.3 INHERIT

   INHERIT specifies bbclasses to include from a configuration file. Usually, this
   variable gets appended to by using the += operator.

   The OpenDreambox distribution automatically appends "buildhistory
   recipe_sanity" to INHERIT.

   Default: INHERIT = ""

   Some examples:

   Always build the latest versions of OpenDreambox-related projects from Git:

   INHERIT += "opendreambox-autorev"

    6.5 Setting up a build directory

   To set up a build directory for e.g. DM 7080 run make MACHINE=dm7080. If
   MACHINE=dm7080 has been set in conf/make.conf (default: dm900), you can simply
   run make with no arguments instead. This will create and initialize the
   directory build/dm7080.

    6.6 Building a firmware image

   To build a firmware image for e.g. DM 7080 run make MACHINE=dm7080 image. If
   MACHINE=dm7080 has been set in conf/make.conf (default: dm900), you can simply
   run make image instead.

    6.7 Building a package

   To build a single package, BitBake has to be used directly. First, the
   environment has to be set up, in order to make BitBake available to the shell.
   This can be done with the following command:

   source bitbake.env

   BitBake must be run from the machine’s build directory. For DM 7080 run:

   cd build/dm7080

   In order to build enigma2, run:

   bitbake enigma2.

  7 Development hints

    7.1 Cross-compilation of external software

   OpenDreambox provides a script called cross-compile.env. Once run, the script
   will create the following commands (shell aliases), aiming to ease
   cross-compilation of external source trees:
     * oe_autoreconf - Calls OE’s version of autoreconf. Useful for projects based
       on GNU autotools.
     * oe_runconf - Calls ./configure with parameters suitable for OE. Useful for
       projects based on GNU autotools.
     * oe_runmake - Calls make with parameters suitable for OE. Useful for
       projects based on GNU autotools or GNU make.
     * oe_env - Useful to execute arbitrary commands in the OE environment (e.g.
       oe_env env).
     * oe_setenv - Exports the OE environment to the currently running shell
       session.

   The script needs to know the target machine, which can be one of the supported
   products (see 1.2). Because the script adds aliases to your currently running
   shell session, it has to be invoked using source or . (the dot operator), e.g.:

   source cross-compile.env dm7080

   The script may be called from any location, but must reside inside the
   OpenDreambox Git tree. You may want to create a symlink to cross-compile.env
   somewhere in your PATH.

    7.2 Coding style

   Run scripts/do_stylize.sh on new recipes to ensure proper coding style.

    7.3 Package architecture

   Set PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}" if either condition is met:
     * The recipe uses COMBINED_FEATURES, MACHINE_FEATURES or DREAMBOX_FEATURES.
     * The recipe uses COMPATIBLE_MACHINE.
     * The recipe is part of meta-dreambox.

  8 Bug reports and patches

   Please send bug reports to bugs@opendreambox.org and patches to
   patches@opendreambox.org.

   A comfortable way to create patches is to use git format-patch, after all
   changes have been committed to your local copy of the repository.
